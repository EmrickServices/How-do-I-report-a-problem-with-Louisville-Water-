                    <li>Open the water pressure gauge’s valve slowly and observe the pressure reading. Normal water pressure should be around 40 to 60 pounds per square inch (psi).</li>
                    <li>If the pressure reading is higher or lower than the normal range, you may have a water pressure issue that needs to be addressed.</li>

                    <li>Consider using water-saving devices, such as low-flow showerheads and faucets, to help reduce water pressure.</li>
